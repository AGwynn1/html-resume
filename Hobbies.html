<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy immersing myself in the world of literature, 
often alternating between reading and listening to audiobooks. 
additionally, my passion for web development allows me to explore 
the ever-evolving digital landscape, andhoning my skills.</p>

<p>I am an avid follower of all things NASA, captivated by the wonders 
of space exploration and scientific discoveries. On a more grounded note, 
I find joy in cheering for my favorite sports team, the New York Knicks, 
To balance the digital and sports realms, 
I prioritize quality family time through movie nights with my children, creating cherished 
memories together.</p>
